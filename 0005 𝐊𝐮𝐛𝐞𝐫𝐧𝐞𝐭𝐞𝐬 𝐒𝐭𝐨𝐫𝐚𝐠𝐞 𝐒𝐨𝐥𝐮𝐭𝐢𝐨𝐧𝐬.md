𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐊𝐮𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐬 𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬?

𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞: Containerized applications often require storage that outlives the container’s lifecycle.
𝐏𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲: Ensure data persistence across different cloud or on-premises environments.
𝐒𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲: Expand storage needs in tandem with application growth.
𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐊𝐮𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐬 𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬:

𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐕𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐦𝐞𝐬 (𝐏𝐕) & 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐕𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐦𝐞 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐦𝐬 (𝐏𝐕𝐂):
𝐔𝐬𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐞: A media company streaming videos needs to store vast amounts of data without losing them when a pod restarts. They use PVs for long-term storage and PVCs to let applications claim storage resources dynamically.
2. 𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐬:

Dictate the type of storage provisioned. Helps in automating the storage provisioning process.
𝐔𝐬𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐞: An e-commerce company, with a seasonal sales peak, uses different storage classes to provision faster, SSD-backed storage during sales and switches back to regular storage post-sale.
3. 𝐃𝐲𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐜 𝐕𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐦𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠:

Eliminate the manual creation of PV. Storage is provisioned automatically based on PVC demands.
𝐔𝐬𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐞: A SaaS startup with fluctuating user growth uses dynamic volume provisioning to auto-scale storage based on real-time user data requirements.
4. 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐟𝐮𝐥𝐒𝐞𝐭𝐬:

Manage stateful applications and their storage requirements.
𝐔𝐬𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐞: A financial services company running a distributed database (like Cassandra) on K8s uses StatefulSets to ensure ordered deployment, scaling, and deletion.
5. 𝐕𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐦𝐞 𝐒𝐧𝐚𝐩𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐭𝐬:

Create/restore snapshots from the API.
𝐔𝐬𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐞: A healthcare app storing patient data uses snapshots to regularly backup critical data, ensuring data integrity and quick recovery.
𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧:

Kubernetes has made leaps in addressing storage challenges for containerized applications. Its versatile storage solutions cater to varying demands, ensuring applications remain resilient and data intact.
