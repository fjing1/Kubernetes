1. What is a Kubernetes Pod, and why is it considered the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes?

- A Kubernetes Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, representing a **single instance of a running process** in a cluster. It’s considered the smallest because it can contain one or more **1+ containers** that share the same network namespace, storage, and IP address. This co-location enables containers in a Pod to **communicate with each other** easily.

2. Explain the difference between a Pod and a Deployment in Kubernetes.

- A Pod represents a single instance of a containerized application,
- a Deployment is a higher-level abstraction that **manages** the desired state of one or more Pods. Deployments ensure that a specified number of Pod replicas are running, making them suitable for maintaining application availability and scaling.

3. How can you define multiple containers within a single Pod, and what are the benefits of doing so?

- Multiple containers within a single Pod can be defined in the Pod’s **YAML** manifest under the `spec.containers` field. Benefits include shared network and storage namespaces, allowing containers to easily communicate and share data. It’s useful for scenarios like sidecars, where additional processes support the primary application.

5. How does Kubernetes ensure that containers within the same Pod can communicate with each other?

- Containers within the same Pod share the **same network namespace**, allowing them to communicate via `localhost`. They also share the same storage volumes, making data sharing straightforward. This built-in networking and storage isolation simplify inter-container communication.

6. What are resource requests and limits in Kubernetes Pods, and why are they important for resource management?

- Resource requests specify the minimum amount of CPU and memory required for a container to run. Resource limits set the maximum allowed CPU and memory usage. They ensure fair allocation of resources, prevent resource contention, and improve overall cluster stability.

7. Explain the concept of readiness probes and liveness probes in the context of Kubernetes Pods.

- Readiness probes determine when a Pod is ready to receive traffic, helping Kubernetes avoid sending requests to unhealthy Pods. Liveness probes check if a container is still running; if not, Kubernetes can restart the container. Both probes are vital for maintaining the availability and reliability of applications.

8. What is a PodDisruptionBudget, and how can it be useful in ensuring high availability during maintenance or disruptions?

- A PodDisruptionBudget is a resource that specifies how many Pods of a particular application can be **disrupted simultaneously**. It helps ensure that a minimum number of Pods remain available during node maintenance or disruptions, minimizing downtime and maintaining high availability.

9. When might you use a StatefulSet instead of a Deployment in Kubernetes, and what are the key differences between the two?

- StatefulSets are suitable for stateful applications like databases, where each Pod has a stable network identity and needs ordered scaling. Deployments are better suited for stateless applications that can scale horizontally. StatefulSets also provide ordered Pod creation and deletion, while Deployments focus on maintaining a desired replica count.

10. How can you update the configuration or image of a running Pod without deleting it?

- You can update a running Pod’s configuration or image by applying changes to the associated **Deployment** or StatefulSet. Kubernetes will automatically manage the rolling update process, ensuring minimal downtime and a smooth transition.

11. Explain how you can configure **environment variables** for containers within a Kubernetes Pod.

- Environment variables for containers within a Pod can be configured in the Pod’s YAML manifest under the `spec.containers.env` field. You can define variables statically or use ConfigMaps and Secrets to inject them dynamically.

12. What are the differences between an Ephemeral Volume and a Persistent Volume in Kubernetes, and when would you use each with Pods?

- Ephemeral Volumes are **temporary and tied to the Pod’s lifecycle**, while Persistent Volumes (PVs) are external storage volumes that persist data beyond a Pod’s lifecycle. Use Ephemeral Volumes for temporary storage, and PVs for long-term data storage that needs to survive Pod restarts.

13. How does Kubernetes handle the rescheduling of Pods when a node fails or becomes unavailable?

- Kubernetes uses its control plane to detect node failures. When a node becomes unavailable, Pods running on that node are rescheduled to healthy nodes in the cluster, ensuring high availability and minimal disruption.

14. What is a PodSecurityPolicy, and how can it be used to enhance security when deploying Pods?

- A PodSecurityPolicy is a resource that defines a set of security policies and constraints for Pods. It can control aspects like allowed volume types, host namespaces, and more. Using PodSecurityPolicies helps enforce security best practices across your cluster.

15. Explain how you can limit the resources a Pod can consume using resource quotas in Kubernetes.

- Resource quotas are used to limit the total CPU and memory resources that can be consumed by Pods in a namespace. By setting resource quotas, you prevent individual Pods from monopolizing cluster resources, ensuring fair resource allocation.

16. What are Init Containers in Kubernetes, and in what scenarios might you use them?

- Init Containers are containers that run before the main containers in a Pod. They are used for tasks like application setup, database schema migrations, or pre-loading data. Init Containers ensure that the main application container starts in a predictable state.

17. How can you debug issues with Pods in Kubernetes? Provide some common troubleshooting techniques.

— Viewing Pod logs with `kubectl logs`.
— Executing commands in a running container with `kubectl exec`.
— Inspecting events and Pod descriptions with `kubectl describe`.
— Checking resource utilization and status with `kubectl top`.

19. What is a Pod Template in the context of a Kubernetes Deployment, and how does it affect the Pods created by the Deployment?

- A Pod Template is part of a Kubernetes Deployment’s specification that defines the desired state of the Pods it manages. When you update the Pod Template, the Deployment automatically manages the rollout of new Pods to match the updated configuration or image.

20. Can you describe the rolling update strategy in Kubernetes Deployments and how it ensures zero-downtime updates of Pods?

- The rolling update strategy in Kubernetes Deployments **gradually replaces old Pods with new ones** 25%, ensuring zero-downtime updates. It does this by creating new Pods and scaling down the old ones in a controlled manner, allowing the application to continue serving traffic while the update is in progress.
