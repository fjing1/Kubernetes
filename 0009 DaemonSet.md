A 𝐃𝐚𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐒𝐞𝐭 ensures that all (or some) nodes run a copy of a Pod. As nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are added to them. Conversely, as nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage-collected. This makes sure that a specified Pod runs on every node or specific nodes, based on your criteria.
Why is DaemonSet Significant?
𝐍𝐨𝐝𝐞-𝐋𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬:
There are certain tasks in a cluster that are best managed on a node-by-node basis. DaemonSets are designed to support these types of operations.
2. 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐞 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 & 𝐋𝐨𝐠𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐠:

For tools like node-level log aggregators, monitoring agents, or any other application that needs to maintain a presence on all nodes, DaemonSets are invaluable. For example, if you have a tool that collects system metrics like CPU or memory usage, you’d use a DaemonSet to ensure that it’s collecting data from every node.
3. 𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠:

DaemonSets can be used to run storage daemon applications, which manage or interact with local storage, or networking applications that manage network configurations.
4. 𝐇𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞 & 𝐒𝐨𝐟𝐭𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐇𝐲𝐠𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐞:

If you have specific drivers or software that need to be present on every node, a DaemonSet is an ideal choice to deploy and ensure the presence of that software.
5. 𝐍𝐨𝐝𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:

Although the primary idea behind DaemonSets is to run a copy of the pod across all nodes, you can also specify node criteria. This means you can instruct the DaemonSet to only deploy the pod on nodes that meet certain conditions (e.g., nodes with a specific type of GPU).

### Practical Example:
Imagine you have a cluster with nodes spread across multiple geographical regions. You want to deploy a monitoring tool that not only checks the health and performance of each node but also reports data specific to its geographical location. With DaemonSets, you can ensure:

Each node in the cluster has a copy of this monitoring tool.
As new nodes are added (perhaps in new geographical locations), they automatically get this monitoring tool.
If a node is decommissioned, the tool’s instance on that node is automatically removed.
In this scenario, the DaemonSet guarantees that every node, regardless of its location, is monitored consistently and efficiently.

Real-World Use Case: Implementing Node-Level Logging with Fluentd
𝐁𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐠𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝: Imagine you are working for a medium-to-large scale e-commerce company. The company’s infrastructure is distributed across multiple nodes in a Kubernetes cluster. To ensure optimal performance and troubleshoot issues, you need a robust logging mechanism that captures logs from every node in the cluster.

𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦: With the dynamic nature of Kubernetes, where pods are continuously created and terminated, and nodes can be added or removed, maintaining a consistent logging solution can be challenging. It’s imperative to capture logs from every node, and when new nodes are added, they should automatically have the logging agent without manual intervention.

𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐃𝐚𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐒𝐞𝐭𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐅𝐥𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐝

𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐅𝐥𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐝: Fluentd is an open-source data collector that unifies data collection and consumption for better use and understanding by humans. It’s a popular choice for Kubernetes logging because it’s lightweight and can be easily integrated with other systems.
2. 𝐃𝐚𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐒𝐞𝐭 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭: By deploying Fluentd as a DaemonSet in your Kubernetes cluster, you ensure that:

Every node in the cluster runs a Fluentd pod instance.
When a new node is added to the cluster, the DaemonSet automatically deploys Fluentd to that node.
If a node is removed, the Fluentd instance on that node is also terminated.
3. 𝐋𝐨𝐠 𝐀𝐠𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:

Fluentd collects logs from each node and can forward them to a centralized logging solution, such as Elasticsearch, CloudWatch, or any other log storage solution your company might be using.
This provides a centralized location to view, analyze, and alert on logs from all nodes in the Kubernetes cluster.
4. 𝐄𝐧𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐓𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠:

If there’s a spike in errors or unusual activity on any node, the logs are readily available for analysis.
With the centralized logging solution in place, you can set up alerts or visualizations to track and respond to anomalies.
𝐎𝐮𝐭𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞:With Fluentd deployed via DaemonSets, the e-commerce company now has a reliable and consistent logging mechanism across the entire Kubernetes cluster. This solution ensures that no logs are missed, even as the cluster evolves and changes. The DevOps and IT teams can swiftly respond to issues, ensuring optimal performance and user experience for the company’s customers.

In this real-world use case, DaemonSets provide a scalable and efficient method to implement a critical infrastructure component (Fluentd) across a dynamic Kubernetes environment.

In Conclusion:
For DevOps professionals, DaemonSets simplify the process of managing node-specific applications within a Kubernetes cluster. They automate the deployment and scaling process, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and compliance across the entire node fleet. Whether it’s for monitoring, logging, hardware management, or any other node-specific task, DaemonSets are a powerful tool in the Kubernetes arsenal.
