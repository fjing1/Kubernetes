Imagine you’re working on an e-commerce platform, and you have to migrate user data from an older database schema to a new one. This task should run once and should be automated to ensure it’s done consistently across different environments.


𝐃𝐨𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐳𝐞 𝐘𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐌𝐢𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭:
Write a script (e.g., Python, Bash) that handles the migration logic.
Create a Docker image with the script:
Docke file:

FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

CMD [“python”, “migrate.py”]

Push this image to a registry, e.g., my-registry/my-migration-image:latest.
